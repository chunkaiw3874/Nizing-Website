                        <td>More commonly known as Silicone, Polymerized siloxanes are mixed inorganic-organic polymers with the chemical formula [R2SiO]<em>n</em>, where R is an organic group such as methyl, ethyl, or phenyl. These materials consist of an inorganic silicon-oxygen backbone chain (...-Si-O-Si-O-Si-O-...) with organic side groups attached to the silicon atoms, which are tetravalent.<br />
                In some cases, organic side groups can be used to link two or more of these -Si-O- backbones together. By varying the -Si-O- chain lengths, side groups, and crosslinking</a>, silicones can be synthesized with a wide variety of properties and compositions. They can vary in consistency from liquid to gel to rubber to hard plastic. The most common siloxane is linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a silicone oil. The second largest group of silicone materials is based on silicone resins, which are formed by branched and cage-like oligosiloxanes.<br />

Silicones exhibit many useful characteristics, listed as follows:<br />
1. Low thermal conductivity<br />
2. Low chemical reactivity<br />
3. Low toxicity<br />
4. Thermal stability (constancy of properties over a wide temperature range of −100 to 250°C).<br />
5. The ability to repel water and form watertight seals.<br />
6. Does not stick to many substrates, but adheres very well to others, e.g. glass.<br />
7. Does not support microbiological growth.<br />
8. Resistance to oxygen, ozone, and ultraviolet (UV) light. This property has led to widespread use of silicones in the construction industry (e.g. coatings, fire protection, glazing seals) and the automotive industry (external gaskets, external trim).<br />
9. Electrical insulation properties. Because silicone can be formulated to be electrically insulative or conductive, it is suitable for a wide range of electrical applications.<br />
10. High gas permeability: at room temperature (25°C), the permeability of silicone rubber for such gases as oxygen is approximately 400 times[citation needed] that of butyl rubber, making silicone useful for medical applications in which increased aeration is desired. Consequently, silicone rubbers cannot be used where gas-tight seals are necessary.</td>
