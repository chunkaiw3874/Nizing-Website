                        <td>Unlike the chemical cross-linking which occurs in thermoset rubbers, TPE involves purely physical cross-linking, which can be reversed via the further application of heat, this makes it possible to re-use all production waste and end of life products can be easily reprocessed.<br />
TPEs exhibit elasticity similar to that of a cross-linked rubber. Their softness or hardness value is measured on the Shore durometer scale. Our TPEs are available as ultra-soft gel like materials measuring 0 Shore A through to rigid materials measuring up to 65 Shore D, and just about every variation in-between.<br />
It is this design flexibility, high-performance and ease of processing that has led to designers increasingly turning to TPEs as their material of choice. TPEs are used in a variety of applications in the automotive, medical, construction, electrical, appliance, packaging and industrial markets – and new uses for TPEs are being developed all the time.</td>

            	        <td>TPS</td>
                        <td>Thermoplastic elastomers described as TPS are compounds based on SBS or SEBS. In fact, the words SBS or SEBS are often used to describe these compounds when they are in fact raw materials. By describing compounds as SBS or SEBS it enables us to know the general level of performance and properties of the compound.<br />
SBS is based on two-phase block copolymers with hard and soft segments. The styrene end blocks provide the thermoplastic properties and the Butadiene mid-blocks provide the elastomeric properties. SBS is probably the highest volume TPS material produced and is commonly used in footwear, adhesives and lower specification seals and grips, where resistance to chemicals and aging are not critical.<br />
SBS, when hydrogenated, becomes SEBS, as the elimination of the C=C bonds in the butadiene component generated ethylene and butylenes mid-block, hence the SEBS acronym. SEBS is characterised by improved heat resistance, mechanical properties and chemical resistance.  SEBS exhibit excellent weathering, UV and ozone resistance making them ideal choice for outdoor and long service life applications. SEBS based compounds adhere to engineering thermoplastics, when adhering to PP both SBS and SEBS can be used.</td>

                        <td>TPO compounds are resin blends of polypropylene (PP) and un-crosslinked EPDM rubber and polyethylene. They are characterised by high impact resistance, low density and good chemical resistance.<br />
They are used in applications where there is a requirement for increased toughness and durability over the conventional PP copolymers, such as automotive bumpers and dashboards. The properties are restricted to the high end of the hardness scale, typically >80 Shore A and with limited elastomeric properties.<br />
TPOs can be easily processed by injection moulding, extrusion or blow moulding.</td>

                        <td>TPV compounds are the next step up in performance from TPO. These too are compounds of PP and EPDM rubber, however they have been dynamically vulcanised during the compounding step. They were originally conceived to bridge the gap between thermoplastic materials and vulcanised EPDM.<br />
They have seen strong growth in  automotive seals, pipe seals, and other applications where a heat resistance of up to 120 degree C is required. Shore hardness values range typically from 45A to 45D. TPVs also lend themselves to under-bonnet automotive applications where improved temperature and oil resistance is required.<br />
TPV compounds feature the following properties:<br />
1. High temperature resistance<br />
2. Wide range of hardnesses<br />
3. Resistance to chemicals and weathering<br />
4. Low compression set<br />
5. Flex fatigue resistance<br />
6. Lightweight<br />
7. Good colourability </td>

Typical Properties:<br />
High elongation and tensile strength<br />
Excellent abrasion resistance<br />
Low-temperature performance<br />
Excellent mechanical properties, combined with a rubber-like elasticity<br />
High transparency<br />  
Good oil and grease resistance</td>

Special grades include heat-stabilized, flame-retardant and blow-molded. Concentrates include black pigments, UV protection additives, hydrolysis-resistant additives, heat stabilizers and flame retardants.<br />
TPEE is ideal for parts requiring excellent flex fatigue and broad use-temperature characteristics. It resists tearing, flex-cut growth, creep and abrasion. It offers strength and stiffness plus outstanding toughness while resisting hydrocarbons and many other fluids.</td>

Due to its low hygroscopicity, TPA can be processed without special drying. Thus the stability of product made by TPA is very well. It is often applied on pipelines which high heat resistance, resilience, and wearability demand.</td>

                        <td>MPPO have a high heat distortion resistance, low water absorption and high strength. MPPO have a wide application temperature range (-40 to 130°C).<br />
MPPO blends can be substantially modified by including rubber impact modifiers and other alloying agents to modify the properties of the original alloy. One typical alloy is 'PPO + PA' which is used as a replacement for PA in automotive applications that may need to with stand paint stoving lines.<br />
Thermal properties<br />
MPPO has a higher heat deformation resistance than many general purpose thermoplastics at a lower price than the more expensive 'engineering thermoplastics'. One of the main reasons for using the PPO blends is the outstanding dimensional stability at elevated temperatures and the broad temperature use range.<br />
Fire behaviour<br />
Conventional grades are non self-extinguishing but self-extinguishing grades (generally made by including phosphorous based additives) are available with a slightly lower heat distortion temperature and impact strength. As a general rule the materials are difficult to ignite and burn with a sooty luminous flame and a pungent odour but do not drip. The flammability ranges from UL 94 HB to V-0 depending on the grade tested.<br />
Electrical properties<br />
Moisture absorption is low over a wide range of humidity levels and therefore dielectric properties are excellent over a wide range of moisture and temperature conditions.<br />
Optical properties<br />
MPPO  are opaque but can easily be coloured a wide range of colours.<br />
MPPO are resistant to acids, alkalis, most salt solutions and alcohols<br />
MPPO are not resistant to benzene, chlorohydocarbons, ketones and many halogenated or aromatic hydrocarbons.<br />
Dimensional changes are negligible even in boiling water.<br />
Weathering resistance:<br />
MPPO have good weathering resistance when adequately stabilised but uncoloured grades will yellow in UV. Black grades have the best UV resistance.<br />
Stress cracking resistance:<br />
Stress cracking resistance is high for most common solvents at low temperatures.</td>
